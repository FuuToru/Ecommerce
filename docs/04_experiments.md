### 4.3. Result

- Achievements: Completed MVP product
    - Customers can view any product on the website, search for products, add product reviews, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.
    - Vendors can add and delete products, view order statistics, and see product reviews.
    - Administrators can view overall statistics of the website such as the number of customers, sellers, and orders.
- Incomplete:
    - The payment feature is still under research due to the lack of resources for testing.
    - The search function is not yet optimal and is still under development, as it cannot perform comprehensive product searches.
- Future development directions for the website:
    - Add the category and admin page features. Currently, these functions are not available, and administrators have to add them directly through the database.
    - Find methods to transfer data faster, especially image data.
    - Optimize the database.
    - Improve the product search functionality.
    - Add new features such as interactions between sellers and buyers, applying discount codes for products, etc.
